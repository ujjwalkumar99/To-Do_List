# PROJECT TITLE - To-Do_List

🔧 In this project, I developed a To-Do List application with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). The application allows users to efficiently manage their tasks, set priorities, and mark tasks as completed.

🏢 TechnoHacksEduTech has been an amazing platform for me to learn and grow as a Python developer. 📚 The internship has provided me with valuable hands-on experience and exposure to real-world projects.

🎯 Looking forward to more exciting projects and opportunities to contribute my skills as a Python developer! 💪 #PythonDeveloper #Internship #TechnoHacksEduTech #To-DoListGUI
